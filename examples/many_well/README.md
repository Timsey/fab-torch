# Many Well Problem
## Training
All training scripts are provided in the Makefile. 

## Evaluation
We provide the trained model parameters in the models folder. These can then be evaluated using
[`evaluation.py`](evaluation.py) to obtain the results from the paper. 
Furthermore [`results_vis.py`](results_vis.py) and ['results_vis_appendix.py`](results_vis_appendix.py) 
may be used to obtain the plot from the paper
visualising each of the modes.
